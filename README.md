Project: Landing Page

This projectâ€™s goal is to create a landing page from scratch. It will apply the basics of HTML, CSS, and Flexbox to create a standard landing page mimicking the one provided by the Odin Project.

By design, the provided landing page also includes elements and designs not yet learned. The purpose of this is to develop the skills and tools needed to find solutions for queries since developers constantly use Google for problem solving. It is an essential tool of the trade.

Upon completion, there were several areas which proved to be more difficult to reproduce. Creative solutions were adopted though one wonders if there were more elegant ways to accomplish the tasks. These areas involved: the manipulation of images in the flex box (section 1 [limit image contaner to be equal to half the parent container]and 2 [appropriate scaling of images]), the use of margins in the parent containers vis-a-vis the application of CSS elements (sections 1 and 4 blue background), the use of wrap to create potentially fixed layouts (e.g, sections 1 and 4 and specifically how to align a lone object in one column), and the manipulation of child contaners for stylistic purposes (section 3 quote's author alignment).
