Project: Landing Page

This projectâ€™s goal is to create a landing page from scratch. It will apply the basics of HTML, CSS, and Flexbox to create a standard landing page mimicking the one provided by the Odin Project.

By design, the provided landing page also includes elements and designs not yet learned. The purpose of this is to develop the skills and tools needed to find solutions for queries since developers constantly use Google for problem solving. It is an essential tool of the trade.
